└── lib/data.ts                               # Data types and sample data
```

### Key Technologies

- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and functional components
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the implementation
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for responsive design
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives for dialogs and forms
- **Lucide React**: Consistent iconography throughout the interface

### Data Model

#### FinancialReport Type

```typescript
type FinancialReport = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  type: 'profit-loss' | 'balance-sheet' | 'cash-flow' | 'general-ledger' | 'trial-balance' | 'custom';
  status: 'draft' | 'active' | 'archived';
  isScheduled: boolean;
  scheduleFrequency?: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'quarterly' | 'yearly';
  dateRange: { startDate: Date; endDate: Date };
  createdDate: Date;
  lastGenerated?: Date;
  parameters: {
    includeSubaccounts: boolean;
    showComparisons: boolean;
    groupByCategory: boolean;
    includeCharts: boolean;
    format: 'pdf' | 'excel' | 'csv';
  };
  filters: {
    accountTypes?: string[];
    projects?: string[];
    clients?: string[];
    minimumAmount?: number;
  };
  createdBy: string;
  tags: string[];
};
```

## State Management

### Local State Architecture

```typescript
// Core data state
const [reports, setReports] = useState<FinancialReport[]>(financialReports);

// Dialog management
const [addEditReportDialogOpen, setAddEditReportDialogOpen] = useState(false);
const [deleteReportDialogOpen, setDeleteReportDialogOpen] = useState(false);
const [bulkReportDialogOpen, setBulkReportDialogOpen] = useState(false);
const [viewReportDialogOpen, setViewReportDialogOpen] = useState(false);
const [selectedReport, setSelectedReport] = useState<FinancialReport | null>(null);

// Filtering state
const [reportSearchTerm, setReportSearchTerm] = useState("");
const [reportFilterType, setReportFilterType] = useState<string>("all");
const [reportFilterStatus, setReportFilterStatus] = useState<"all" | "draft" | "active" | "archived">("all");
```

### Performance Optimizations

- **useMemo**: Memoized filtering operations to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Controlled Components**: Efficient state updates for form inputs
- **Debounced Search**: Real-time search without performance impact
