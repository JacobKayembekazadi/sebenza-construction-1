# Bank Reconciliation Feature - Full CRUD Implementation

## Overview

The Bank Reconciliation feature provides a comprehensive transaction management system that allows construction companies to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on bank transactions, along with advanced reconciliation capabilities to match bank statements with system transactions.

## Features

### Full CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Add new bank transactions manually or via CSV import
- **Read**: View, search, and filter all bank transactions with advanced filtering
- **Update**: Edit transaction details, categories, and reconciliation status
- **Delete**: Remove individual transactions or perform bulk deletions

### Core Functionality
- **Two-Panel Interface**: Bank transactions on the left, system transactions on the right (in separate reconciliation view)
- **Interactive Management**: Complete transaction lifecycle management
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded status indicators for reconciled, unmatched, and categorized transactions
- **Progress Tracking**: Summary cards showing transaction metrics and reconciliation progress
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant feedback with toast notifications

### Data Management
- **System Integration**: Uses real invoice and expense data from the application
- **Flexible Import**: CSV file import with validation and error handling
- **Bulk Operations**: Select and perform operations on multiple transactions
- **Export Capabilities**: Export filtered transaction data to CSV
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by type, reconciliation status, bank account, and search terms

### User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet devices
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios and keyboard navigation
- **Modern UI**: Uses Shadcn/UI components for consistent design
- **Truncated Text**: Long descriptions are truncated for better table layout

├── page.tsx                           # Main accounting page with reconciliation tab

src/components/
├── add-edit-bank-transaction-dialog.tsx    # Add/Edit transaction dialog
├── delete-bank-transaction-dialog.tsx      # Delete confirmation dialog
├── bulk-operation-dialog.tsx               # Bulk operations dialog
└── import-transaction-dialog.tsx           # CSV import dialog
```

### Dependencies
- **React Hooks**: useState, useMemo for state management
- **Shadcn/UI Components**: Card, Table, Badge, Button, Dialog, Input, Select, Checkbox
- **Data Sources**: Real invoices and expenses from `/lib/data.ts`, bank account data

  description: string;
  amount: number;
  type: 'credit' | 'debit';
  bankAccountId: string;
  category?: string;
  reference?: string;
  reconciled?: boolean;
};
```

### CRUD Operations

2. **Read**: Display transactions with filtering, searching, and pagination
3. **Update**: Edit transaction fields, update reconciliation status, bulk updates
4. **Delete**: Remove transactions individually or in bulk with confirmation

### State Management
- Local state using React useState for transaction data
- Filtered views using useMemo for performance
- Real-time updates with immediate UI feedback

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Advanced Reconciliation**: AI-powered automatic transaction matching with system data
- **Bank API Integration**: Direct connection to banking APIs for real-time data
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Generate detailed reconciliation reports with analytics
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all transaction changes and reconciliation actions
- **Recurring Transactions**: Automatic creation of recurring transactions
- **Transaction Rules**: Custom rules for automatic categorization and processing

### Integration Points
- **Accounting Integration**: Export to QuickBooks, Xero, and other accounting platforms
- **Multi-Bank Support**: Handle multiple bank accounts with consolidated views
- **Scheduled Operations**: Automated daily/weekly reconciliation and reporting
- **Mobile Support**: Mobile app for transaction management and approval workflows
- **API Integration**: RESTful API for third-party integrations

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Role-based Access**: Only Admin/Owner roles can access
- **Secure Data Handling**: Bank data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Audit Logging**: All reconciliation actions logged for compliance

### Best Practices
- Regular backup of reconciliation data
- Two-factor authentication for bank data access
- Segregation of duties for financial operations

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **CSV Import Errors**: Check file format (Date, Description, Amount, Reference) and data validation
2. **Missing Transactions**: Verify bank account connections and import settings
3. **Reconciliation Discrepancies**: Review transaction categories and amounts for accuracy
4. **Performance Issues**: Use filters to limit displayed data for large transaction sets
5. **Validation Errors**: Ensure all required fields are filled correctly when adding/editing

### Data Validation Rules
- **Date**: Must be in valid date format (YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, or MM-DD-YYYY)
- **Description**: Minimum 3 characters required
- **Amount**: Must be a valid positive number
- **Bank Account**: Must be selected from available connected accounts

### Best Practices
- **Regular Imports**: Import bank statements frequently to keep data current
- **Consistent Categorization**: Use standard categories for better reporting
- **Backup Before Bulk Operations**: Export data before performing bulk deletions
- **Review Reconciliation**: Regularly review reconciled transactions for accuracy
